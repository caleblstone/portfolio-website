    <a href="http://www.experimentalarchive.space" target="_blank">Experimental Archive</a>
    is a generative archive of <a href="https://space1026.com" target="_blank">Space 1026</a>, one of the longest-running DIY arts spaces in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">U.S.A.</a>  
    <br><br>
    Created in collaboration with <a href="https://leetusman.com" target="_blank">Lee Tusman</a>, the website is the prototype for an
    ongoing series of generative archives that aim to provide tools for ephemeral or precarious arts spaces to both document their existence
    and pass on knowledge concerning how to organize, run, and maintain such a space. 
    <br><br>
    In the spirit of Space 1026's ethos, we designed the archive to be navigable through booklets generated using <a href="https://bindery.info" target="_blank">Bindery.js</a>.
    Each generated booklet is unique and contains a limited set of information from Space 1026's abundant archive. Additonally, each website
    is developed with longevity in mind, relying as much as possible on HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS.

          <br><br>
          I made this project with the hope that it would help dispel the myth of ‚Äúthe cloud.‚Äù
          The internet exists in physical space, and when we use the internet we use land. Most
          of the internet is stored within large, energy intensive spaces that we call ‚Äúserver farms.‚Äù
          However, these ‚Äúfarms‚Äù are not community gardens, they are industrial plantations, exploiting
          the land and rendering it unusable by creatures of all sorts. And like industrial agriculture on
          much of the American continents, these server ‚Äúfarms‚Äù extract value from land that doesn‚Äôt belong
          to those who profit from them.
          <br><br>
          This project can be used as a useful tool, but its primary purpose is to encourage users
          to rethink what the internet is. Acknowledging land is rather performative without considering
          reparative methods that attempt to cede colonial control of indigenous soil. How then, do we
          build a web that dismantles colonial, profit-driven digital infrastructure ‚Äî a web developed
          by the stewards of the land it occupies? What would network infrastructure look like if designed
          using indigenous agricultural logic? How can we plant digital community gardens? Can there be
          native code as there are native organisms? üå±

          The decision to use the font, Arial was inspired by
          <a href="https://mindyseu.com/" target="_blank">Mindy Seu</a>'s

          <a href="https://cyberfeminismindex.com/" target="_blank">Cyberfeminism Index</a>.
          Additionally, the decision to place white text on a black background was inspired by
          <a href="https://unbag.net/end/black-gooey-universe" target="_blank">American Artist</a> and
          <a href="https://www.wheelersburg.net/Downloads/Hurston.pdf" target="_blank">Zora Neale Hurston</a>'s

            Inspired by the famed monastery of Lindisfarne, William Irwin Thompson founded

<!-- ABITER Expanded -->
      <div class="expanded" id="arbiterExpanded">
        <div class="introduction">

          For my Programming for Visual Artists class at Purchase College, I designed a piece of software as a component of a performance.  I had partnered with another student in the dance conservatory to record an actual performance of the piece, yet it was cancelled due to COVID-19.
          <br><br>
          ARBITER is intended to be a reflection on the ways in which artificial intelligence algoithms subtly alter our behavior, enforcing a culture of sameness under the guise of assisted individuality. It calls upon Heideggarian philosophy, calling into question the status of our "dasein" in a world in which we use technology to mediate being.
          <br><br>
          ARBITER has two main components. The first is a piece of software that acts as a control mechanism for the performer, issuing both physical and emotional commands that the performer must endure. The second is a piece of software that tracks the motions of the performer and attempts to interpret what the original command was. As such, the performer acts as an intermediary between command and interpretation being in control of neither their own actions nor how they are percieved. A performance was scheduled in collaboration with the Purchase College Dance Conservatory but was unfortunately cancelled due to COVID-19.
          <br><br>
          An early prototype for the command issuing software component:

         <a href="corrocupSite/CorrocupWebsite/index2.html" target="_blank">Corrocup</a> was concieved in a high school art classroom somewhere
         in upstate new york.
         No one thought the cup project would continue
         considering the designer spent as much time casting as he spent cleaning
         the leaking slip released by the primitive plaster casts. Fortunately,
         the designer was able to produce two successful cups, imperfect but functional.

         <br><br>
         During his studies at Pratt Institute, the designer was
         able to learn more professional slip casting techniques at his internship
         at a Brooklyn ceramic studio called
         <a href="https://www.francanyc.com/">franca</a>. The two inspiring women at
         franca assisted in the refinement of his design and manufacturing process,
         allowing him to finally produce the Corrocups that you know and love.

         <img src="assets/corrocup.jpeg" alt="">
         <br><br>
         In a partnership with Blue Marble Brooklyn, the designer was able to
         sell the cups at their prospect heights storefront.
         <br><br>
         To finalize the cups for retail, the designer designed custom packaging and eventually
         decided to build an online store to practice his web design skills.

          Red dot is an experiment in the use of a shared design language to create unity within a line of disparate products.
          <br><br>
          By creating a common design language, the user‚Äôs understanding of one product can translate to all others within the series. Each object uses the same switches, knobs, and sliders alongside a unified color theme. This concept could continue to be applied on a larger scale to create an entire line of goods, satisfying all needs of the user in a way that they understand.

      <div class="about">
        &emsp;&emsp;My name is Caleb Stone and I am a designer, developer, and researcher based
        in Brooklyn, NY.
        <br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;I am currently enrolled as a B.A student
        at <a href="https://www.newschool.edu/" target="_blank">The New School</a>
        studying <a href="https://www.newschool.edu/lang/culture-and-media/" target="_blank">Culture + Media</a>.
        Alongside this program, I am a member of the <a href="https://www.newschool.edu/lang/code-as-a-liberal-art/" target="_blank">Code as a Liberal Art</a> minor.

        <br><br>

        As a designer, I am interested in using ethnographic research to engage in a more socially-focused
        design practice that relies on available materials and local histories.

        <br><br>
        Some things that I've been thinking about are: digital infrastructure, cybernetics,
        clicky buttons, tools and how we touch things with them, the digestive system, hypertext,
        and growing things from the ground.

        <br><br>
        Some books that I like are:
        <li><i>Labyrinths</i> - Jorge Luis Borges</li>
        <li><i>100 Years of Solitude</i> - Gabriel Garcia Marquez</li>
        <li><i>Notes on the Synthesis of Form</i> - Christopher Alexander</li>
        <li><i>Mind and Nature</i> - Gregory Bateson</li>
        <li><i>Parable of the Sower</i> - Octavia Butler</li>
        and a lot more.
