  <div class="introduction">
    <a href="https://caleblstone.github.io/systems-aesthetics-final/" target="_blank">Breathing Museum</a>
    is a final project submitted for <a href="http://www.alanruiz.net" target="_blank">Alan Ruiz's</a> class on Systems Aesthetics.
    <br><br>
    The website is the final documentation of a semester-long group project aiming introduce students to both 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_Critique" target="_blank">institutional critique</a> 
    and critical group <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychodynamics" target="_blank">psychodynamics</a>. 
    Groups organized themselves into "affinity groups" that centered around particular cultural insitutions within 
    New York City and were tasked with conducting fieldwork concerning their institution's boundary conditions. Additionally,
    groups were expected to look inwards and conduct recursive research on how the study of the institution influenced
    the boundary conditions within the group itself. 
    <br><br>
    Leveraging shifting boundaries, blurry layers, and disorienting color fades, I designed and built the website to reflect 
    the particular experiences of our group. The boundary surrounding the site content is set to undulate at the <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/vital-signs-body-temperature-pulse-rate-respiration-rate-blood-pressure"
    target="_blank">rate of the average human breath</a> . As the cursor traveres a section plan of 
    <a href="https://www.newmuseum.org" target="_blank">The New Museum</a>,
    the boundary accelerates or slows in relation to our group's surveyed anxiety levels in the corresponding environments. This boundary is 
    also designed to sometimes include, sometimes exclude, the button linking the the section on our internal group dynamics, reflecting the
    way in which the museum's involvement in our internal conflict varied over time.

    Created in collaboration with <a href="https://leetusman.com" target="_blank">Lee Tusman</a>, the website is the prototype for an
    ongoing series of generative archives that aim to provide tools for ephemeral or precarious arts spaces to both document their existence
    and pass on knowledge concerning how to organize, run, and maintain such a space. 
    <br><br>
    In the spirit of Space 1026's ethos, we designed the archive to be navigable through booklets generated using <a href="https://bindery.info" target="_blank">Bindery.js</a>.
    Each generated booklet is unique and contains a limited set of information from Space 1026's abundant archive. Additonally, each website
    is developed with longevity in mind, relying as much as possible on HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS.

          <br><br>
          I made this project with the hope that it would help dispel the myth of “the cloud.”
          The internet exists in physical space, and when we use the internet we use land. Most
          of the internet is stored within large, energy intensive spaces that we call “server farms.”
          However, these “farms” are not community gardens, they are industrial plantations, exploiting
          the land and rendering it unusable by creatures of all sorts. And like industrial agriculture on
          much of the American continents, these server “farms” extract value from land that doesn’t belong
          to those who profit from them.
          <br><br>
          This project can be used as a useful tool, but its primary purpose is to encourage users
          to rethink what the internet is. Acknowledging land is rather performative without considering
          reparative methods that attempt to cede colonial control of indigenous soil. How then, do we
          build a web that dismantles colonial, profit-driven digital infrastructure — a web developed
          by the stewards of the land it occupies? What would network infrastructure look like if designed
          using indigenous agricultural logic? How can we plant digital community gardens? Can there be
          native code as there are native organisms? 🌱
          <br><br>
          The decision to use the font, Arial was inspired by

          <a href="https://cyberfeminismindex.com/" target="_blank">Cyberfeminism Index</a>.
          Additionally, the decision to place white text on a black background was inspired by
          <a href="https://unbag.net/end/black-gooey-universe" target="_blank">American Artist</a> and
          <a href="https://www.wheelersburg.net/Downloads/Hurston.pdf" target="_blank">Zora Neale Hurston</a>'s

      <!-- Nice Tapes Expanded -->
      <div class="expanded" id="niceTapesExpanded">
        <div class="introduction">
          Since 1979, Ron Drumm has been the record librarian of WHRW-FM, SUNY Binghamton's non-profit radio station. Having developed an incredibly
          expansive knowledge of the music collection, he became a something of a mythical figure to the Binghamton music scene, influencing generations
          of college students who volunteered at the station. To keep in contact with students with whom he had developed close ties, Ron began sending out 
          mixtapes every few months, all accompanied by hand-written letters and tracklists. It is estimated that Ron has sent out well over 10,000 of these
          tapes to friends and family.
          <br><br>
          I was hired by one of these ex-students to build the next stage of these "Nice Tapes," an online archive where Ron could directly publish new mixes.
          While the Nice Tapes have endured several technological changes in how recorded music is shared, transitioning from cassette tapes to CDs to MP3s, I
          wanted to remain mindful of the special physicality of the tapes and their corresponding tracklists.
          <br><br>
          As a means to preserve the spirit of the Nice Tapes, the website balances retro and scrappy aesthetics with contemporary web design practices. Like on
          a cassette player, the only audio control options are fast-forward, rewind, and play/pause. Additionally, the user tracks their progress within a particular
          tape by observing the tape transfer from one wheel to the other. It was also very important to the client to preserve Ron's handwritten tracklists, so I
          created a photoshop script that could be used to convert scanned tracklists into high-quality PNG's with transparent backgrounds for better readability.
          <br><br>
          Unfortunately, the client ended the project before it's completion so it cannot be found on the web. Here are some screenshots of the most up-to-date version:

            Inspired by the famed monastery of Lindisfarne, William Irwin Thompson founded
            the Lindisfarne Association in 1972 to gather together bold scientists, scholars,

<!-- ABITER Expanded -->
      <div class="expanded" id="arbiterExpanded">
        <div class="introduction">

          For my Programming for Visual Artists class at Purchase College, I designed a piece of software as a component of a performance.  I had partnered with another student in the dance conservatory to record an actual performance of the piece, yet it was cancelled due to COVID-19.
          <br><br>
          ARBITER is intended to be a reflection on the ways in which artificial intelligence algoithms subtly alter our behavior, enforcing a culture of sameness under the guise of assisted individuality. It calls upon Heideggarian philosophy, calling into question the status of our "dasein" in a world in which we use technology to mediate being.
          <br><br>
          ARBITER has two main components. The first is a piece of software that acts as a control mechanism for the performer, issuing both physical and emotional commands that the performer must endure. The second is a piece of software that tracks the motions of the performer and attempts to interpret what the original command was. As such, the performer acts as an intermediary between command and interpretation being in control of neither their own actions nor how they are percieved. A performance was scheduled in collaboration with the Purchase College Dance Conservatory but was unfortunately cancelled due to COVID-19.
          <br><br>
          An early prototype for the command issuing software component:

        <div class="introduction">
         <a href="corrocupSite/CorrocupWebsite/index2.html" target="_blank">Corrocup</a> was concieved in a high school art classroom somewhere
         in upstate new york.
         No one thought the cup project would continue
         considering the designer spent as much time casting as he spent cleaning
         the leaking slip released by the primitive plaster casts. Fortunately,
         the designer was able to produce two successful cups, imperfect but functional.

         <br><br>
         During his studies at Pratt Institute, the designer was
         able to learn more professional slip casting techniques at his internship
         at a Brooklyn ceramic studio called
         <a href="https://www.francanyc.com/">franca</a>. The two inspiring women at
         franca assisted in the refinement of his design and manufacturing process,
         allowing him to finally produce the Corrocups that you know and love.

         <br><br>
         In a partnership with Blue Marble Brooklyn, the designer was able to
         sell the cups at their prospect heights storefront.
         <br><br>
         To finalize the cups for retail, the designer designed custom packaging and eventually
         decided to build an online store to practice his web design skills.

<!-- Red Dot Expanded -->
      <div class="expanded" id="redDotExpanded">
        <div class="introduction">
          Red dot is an experiment in the use of a shared design language to create unity within a line of disparate products.
          <br><br>
          By creating a common design language, the user’s understanding of one product can translate to all others within the series. Each object uses the same switches, knobs, and sliders alongside a unified color theme. This concept could continue to be applied on a larger scale to create an entire line of goods, satisfying all needs of the user in a way that they understand.

      <div class="about">
        &emsp;&emsp;My name is Caleb Stone and I am a designer, developer, fabricator, and researcher based
        in Brooklyn, NY.
        <br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;I am currently enrolled as a B.A student
        at <a href="https://www.newschool.edu/" target="_blank">The New School</a>
        studying <a href="https://www.newschool.edu/lang/culture-and-media/" target="_blank">Culture + Media</a>.
        Alongside this program, I have taken many classes in the <a href="https://www.newschool.edu/parsons/mfa-design-technology/" target="_blank">MFA Design + Technology</a>
        program at <a href="https://www.newschool.edu/parsons/">Parsons.</a>

        <br><br>

        As a designer, I am interested in using ethnographic research to engage in a more socially-focused
        design practice that relies on available materials and local histories.

        <br><br>
        Some things that I've been thinking about are: digital infrastructure, new materialism, organic architecture, cybernetics,
        clicky buttons, tools and how we touch things with them, the digestive system, hypertext,
        and growing things from the ground.

        <br><br>
        Some books that I've been into lately:
        <li><i>Labyrinths</i> - Jorge Luis Borges</li>
        <li><i>Are We Human?: Notes on an Archaeology of Design</i> - Beatriz Colomina + Mark Wigley</li>
        <li><i>Notes on the Synthesis of Form</i> - Christopher Alexander</li>
        <li><i>Mind and Nature</i> - Gregory Bateson</li>
        <li><i>The Xenogenesis Trilogy</i> - Octavia Butler</li>
        and a lot more.
